# SilvesBro

**Created by Duck Software**

From Duck Software, introducing **SilvesBro**, a productivity companion app designed to help students at **UTSA** stay accountable, and focused. With our beloved professor **Sam Silvestro** as the virtual mascot, SilvesBro turns studying into something a bit more… animated!

## 🧠 Project Description

SilvesBro is a Tamagotchi-style Android app that combines productivity with humor and accountability. Designed for students, the app encourages users to complete their assignments, track their study time, and take care of their digital companion Mr. (Silvestro) who thrives on **Fountain Dude** (our legal-friendly version of Mountain Dew).

With features like name personalization, character customization, a Pomodoro-style timer, and rewarding task mechanics, SilvesBro helps users stay on top of their work while interacting with a lovable professor.
